CHECKLIST FOR THE DESKTOP

If you are in Regular Swift Linux or Diet Swift Linux, the standard
ROX wallpaper should be displayed.  If you are in a special edition of
Swift Linux, the corresponding ROX wallpaper should be displayed instead.

If you are in Diet Swift Linux, there should be desktop icons giving
you access to AbiWord and Gnumeric.  If you are in Regular Swift Linux
or a special edition, you should have desktop icons giving you
access to LibreOffice Writer and Calc instead.

For all editions of Swift Linux, there should also be desktop icons
giving you access to the PCManFM file manager, the Help pages, the
/usr/share/applications directory, the Software Wizard, the control
center, Geany, ROXTerm, mtPaint, the Network Wizard, Iceweasel, Sylpheed,
a multimedia player, and SearchMonkey.

The Conky display is at the bottom center of the desktop and shows
which edition and version of Swift Linux you are using, what version of
LMDE it is derived from.  Conky should also display the kernel, machine,
time, date, CPU usage, RAM usage, swap usage, free space, and battery
status.

Main menu -> Applications gives you access to the applications listed in 
the /usr/share/applications directory.

Main menu -> Logout -> Logout gives you the options to exit the OS 
(lock, log out, reboot, and shutdown).

The toolbar in the lower left corner gives you options of closing all
windows, pcmanfm, ROXTerm, Geany, Iceweasel, and exiting the OS.

Main menu -> Settings -> Themes shows that win95 is the active theme.

Live CD: The option of installing Swift Linux should be available through
the desktop icon AND through Main Menu -> Applications -> System Tools.

Post-installation: There should be NO option to install Swift Linux.

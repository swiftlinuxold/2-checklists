CHECKLIST FOR BOOTUP

LIVE CD AND POST-INSTALLATION SETUPS:

In the GRUB menu, all references to Linux Mint should be gone and replaced with references to 
Swift Linux.

If you are booting up a special edition of Swift Linux, you should hear the corresponding
startup audio clip as the desktop is loaded up.  (Make sure the audio is enabled.)

LIVE CD ONLY:

When booting up from the live CD, you should reach the Swift Linux desktop automatically.

POST-INSTALLATION SETUP ONLY:

You should get a login screen.  The computer name and the computer icon in the login box should
be gone.  An instruction to press Cancel to try a different login name should be present.

For the regular and diet editions, the login screen should show the standard Swift Linux
wallpaper for LightDM.  For the special edition, the login screen should show the corresponding
LightDM wallpaper.
